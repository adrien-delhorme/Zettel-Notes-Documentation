title: Plugins for Zettel Notes
---

Zettel Notes main application is provided free of charge and will always will be.

To have a sustained income model, I created Plugins. These are seperate apps downloadable from both play store and f-droid. Some are provided as paid apps and some free. Plugins add additional functionality in Zettel Notes. 

Currently following plugins are available in play store and f-droid repository.

1. [AI Chat Plugin](./chat-ai-plugin.md)
1. [Alarm Plugin](./alarm-plugin.md)
2. [Donation Plugin](./donation-plugin.md)
3. [Location Plugin](./location-plugin.md)
4. [Speech to Text Plugin](./speech-to-text-plugin.md)
5. [Speed Read Plugin](./speed-read-plugin.md)
