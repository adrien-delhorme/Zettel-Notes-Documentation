Zettel Notes features per-repository recycle bin. This means that each [repository](./repository/index.md) that you setup in zettel notes will have its own recycle bin

It is enabled by default and has an auto-clean interval of 7 days. You can modify it in `Settings`. You can set maximum auto-clean interval to 30 days. If you set it as 0, files will not be removed from recycle bin.

!!! information

    When you restore files from the recycle bin, they are returned to their original location, where they were initially deleted from.
